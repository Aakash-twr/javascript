// Js Engine Architecture

// Js engine takes code as input it undergoes some steps :

// 1. Parsing - It breaks down our code into tokens - Syntax parser, Abstract syntax tree .

// Js Engine provides a mechanism called JIT - Just In Time Compilation

// Interpreter - It takes our code and just execute line by line.

// Compiler - It basically creates an optimized version of our code and then it is ready to be executed line by line.

// 2. JIT Compilation - It uses both interpreter and compiler.
// At runtime, It interprets and compiles the code at the same time.

// V8 Engine - 
// Interpreter - ignition
// compiler - Turbo Fan
